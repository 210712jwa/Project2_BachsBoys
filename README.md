# BucketBook
The BucketBook social media website will manage users, their Bucket list destinations, and their user friends. All users can login, search for travel destinations, search for other users on the platform, and add those destinations and users to their profile. The User profile page will display a list of travel destinations as well as the other users in the profileâ€™s friends list. Users will be able to add custom destinations for others to view.
